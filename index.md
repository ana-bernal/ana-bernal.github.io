<br/>

🙋🏽 I recently (December 2021) defended a PhD thesis in algebraic combinatorics. I'm learning to code in Python for doing machine learning algorithms. 

🌎 I live in Reims, France. I was born and grew up in Colombia.

### Math research works

I studied bijections relating combinatorial objects, such as integer [partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)), which are themselves (fascinatingly) related to the representation theory of the [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group) and [alternating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_group) groups.

📖 My PhD thesis can be found [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03482899). A github repository with a list of GAP 3 functions related to this work can be found [here](https://github.com/ana-bernal/self-Mullineux-SUBS).
